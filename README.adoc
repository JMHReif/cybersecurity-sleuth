=== Loading the data

There are two options in this repository for loading the data.

1. Load the .dump file
2. Import the CSV files for nodes and relationships

To load the .dump file into a Neo4j Aura instance, you'll need to https://dev.neo4j.com/aura-java[spin up an Aura instance^]. Then click on the instance, go to the `Import` tab, drag+drop the .dump file onto the pane, and wait for the data load to complete. Note: It might take a few extra minutes after the process completes to show the data.

To import the CSV files, you will need to run the Cypher statements in the `import-csv.cypher` file to load the data. _More info coming soon!_
