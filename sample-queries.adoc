= Cybersecurity Graph: Sample Queries

== Query 1

* Find users, groups, and machines for RDP access in a particular 
domain. RDP access allows a hacker to jump from lower-threshold machine such as 
corporate laptop to more mission-critical application hosts.

.Search Phrase
[source,text]
----
Everyone with RDP access in domain <TESTLAB.LOCAL>
----

.Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)
CALL apoc.path.expand(u, 'MEMBER_OF>|CAN_RDP>', 'Group|/Computer', 1, 10) YIELD path
RETURN path
----

*Analysis:* Result is a too much to analyze or make sense of.

== Query 2

* Find a limited set of users, groups, and machines for RDP access.

.Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
//Find some users with access to groups/machines
MATCH (u:User)-[r:MEMBER_OF|CAN_RDP]->(other)
RETURN * LIMIT 50;
----

*Analysis:* Result is easy to look at, but doesn't tell us much.

== Query 3

* What if a user was known hacked/responded to phishing email? Let's find machines to which that user has RDP access in the domain.

.Search Phrase
[source,text]
----
RDP access for <HNOERENBERG04707@TESTLAB.LOCAL>
----

.Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User {displayname: "Henrietta Noerenberg”})-[r:CAN_RDP]->(c:Computer)
RETURN *;
----

*Analysis:* Only a few - things don't look so bad.

== Query 4

* Find groups a user is a member of

.Search Phrase
[source,text]
----
All groups for user <HNOERENBERG04707@TESTLAB.LOCAL>
----

.Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User {displayname: "Henrietta Noerenberg"})-[r:MEMBER_OF*1..]->(g:Group)
RETURN * LIMIT 50;
----

*Analysis:* Hmmmm, interesting. Some groups are hierarchical, so we are inheriting. Requires multi-hop analysis.

== Query 5

* Find groups and machines to which to which a user has RDP access.

.Search Phrase
[source,text]
----
*clear scene*

RDP access via groups for user <HNOERENBERG04707@TESTLAB.LOCAL>
----

.Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
//Find machines Henrietta can access via her groups
MATCH p=(:User {displayname: "Henrietta Noerenberg"})-[:MEMBER_OF*1..]->(:Group)-[:CAN_RDP]->(:Computer)
RETURN p;
----

*Analysis:* Ouch! Now see a broader scope of the problem...but still manageable...or is 
it?

== Query 6

* RDP abilities by group. Shows users, groups, and machines to which they have RDP access in the 
domain.

.Search phrase
[source,text]
----
Remote abilities by groups for user <HNOERENBERG04707@TESTLAB.LOCAL>
----

.Cypher
[source,cypher]
----
//related Cypher
MATCH p=(:User {displayname: "Henrietta Noerenberg"})-[:MEMBER_OF*1..]->(:Group)-[:CAN_RDP|EXECUTE_DCOM|ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE]->(:Computer)
RETURN p
----

*Analysis:* Additional machines that could be impacted - larger network to cover now.

== Query 7

* Who could a single user impact? Find machines, groups, and users impacted by a single exposed account.

.Search Phrase

----

Who could <HNOERENBERG04707@TESTLAB.LOCAL> impact?
----

.Cypher

//related cypher
MATCH p=(:User {displayname: "Henrietta Noerenberg"})-[:CAN_RDP|EXECUTE_DCOM|ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE]->(:Computer)-[:HAS_SESSION]-()
RETURN p LIMIT 50
UNION
MATCH p=(:User {displayname: "Henrietta Noerenberg"})-[:MEMBER_OF*1..]->(:Group)-[:CAN_RDP|EXECUTE_DCOM|ALLOWED_TO_DELEGATE]->(:Computer)-[:HAS_SESSION]-()
RETURN p LIMIT 50
----

*Analysis:* This is getting pretty complex. We have multiple different entities that will need secured and/or cleaned in case of a breach. The impact grows.

== Query 8

* Who are the domain admins? Find if current user/hacked account could get access to a domain admin 
account either directly or via a lateral traversal (via impacted accounts).

.Search Phrase
[source,text]
----
*do not clear scene*

User MEMBER_OF Group name <DOMAIN_ADMIN@TESTLAB.LOCAL>
----

*Analysis:* This is the list of users with admin access. Quite a few, but doesn't show multiple hops here.

== Query 9

* What is the shortest path between a specific user and the admin account?

.Search Phrase
[source,text]
----
*clear scene*

//Find User
User displayname Henrietta Noerenberg

//Find Group admin
Group name DOMAIN ADMINS@TESTLAB.LOCAL

*Select both nodes, right click, path -> shortest path*
----

*Analysis:* The user Abram Bumgarner is the link because both users share similar access. Might need to dig deeper to determine how/why they are similar to avoid attack paths.
